# src/client/js/vendor

Scripts in this folder aren't linted through **JSHint**. This is useful for vendor-provided snippets from sources such as _Google Analytics_, or _Clicky_.

JavaScript libraries **shouldn't** be included here directly, but through `bower` instead.

# `ga.js`

Replace `TRACKING_CODE` with your tracking code, such as `'UA-XXXXXXXX-X'`.

Replace `DOMAIN` with your domain name, such as `example.com`
